# Diploma in Web Development – Milestone Project 1
## ALNBM

#### Project Overview

This project is part of the Diploma in Web Development – Milestone Project 1.
The aim is to design and build a responsive, user-friendly website using core web technologies.

The website is created for ALNBM Architects, an architectural practice where I previously worked as an Architectural Assistant. The site is intended to present and promote the practice’s identity, values, and projects clearly and professionally.
